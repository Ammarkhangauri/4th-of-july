    <p>Dear love,</p>
    <p>
      There's so much that I have to say, idk how do I let it out, how to express it in words but here I am writing this letter trying to bring a smile on your face — the smile that is engraved in my brain of that lil Kabeer smiling ear to ear.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Aaaaghhh now after writing about your smile it's the only thing that I am thinking about rn, baby we have come a long way, even thinking about it puts me in awe — 6 MONTHS, wow.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      How even the distance of 500 km brought us so close ki shayad hi koi aaya hoga.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      You don't know how much you mean to me babe, or maybe I don't let you know enough, but I want you to know you mean the world to me.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Your words, your good mood makes my day, your muft ka gyaan about physics and tech — you might think that bores me but man do I love listening to you.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Everything about Adobe and DaVinci, be it Git or GitHub, what a timeline is, what kind of waves are what, how sound travels and how light travels — aaahhhhhh.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      What I love more is how you give in to my bakwaas about history yapping (and yeah I love being your random facts boyfriend).
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      I might not be as smart as you but I love being yours, which makes me as equally smart as you, since you make me whole.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Yk how 6 months might sound like a long time but it just felt like a heartbeat — went by like a blink of an eye.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      From us meeting on 4th of Jan 🤍, to meeting for the first time on 12th of February, sharing each other’s breath, rolling in each other’s scent — the very best day of my life.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      That date of ours at Safdurjung... you know one more reason why it is so significant? Because Safdurjung was the Nawab of Lucknow and his tomb lies in Delhi — and that’s how it symbolizes us 💖.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      That very kiss of ours with your hand on my neck 😩 and me shouting at you for putting water in the pan — and damn, then going back to long distance.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Well, we had our ups and downs but we proved to be strong and came back stronger.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      All the fun came with all the pain — I’ll always be regretful and seek your forgiveness for it all.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      But baby, don’t ever forget — I love you with all my heart and will always do.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Finally the happiness of our dream of living together came true — each of those days of us coming together, cleaning together, showering together... BHAIIII I MISS YOU 😭.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      AND THEN THOSE CUDDLES, MOVIES, AND SLEEPING SAATH ME. (And obvi your big ahh dihh) 😋.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Penguin, I miss biting and sniffing u :(
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      The JAIPUR TRIP — fuck yaarrrr, those days I miss it.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      VICKYYYYYYYYY, marinated momos — ummmmmm that foodgasm we share is just 💅🤰.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Each day of life of mine has been different since I’ve met you, each day more and more better — just by you being by my side.
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Kehna to aur bhi boht kuch hai, lekin abhi ke liye itna hi...
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      Oyeeee sunn na — I LOVE YOU ♡♥
    </p>
    <p class="line">
      HAPPY 6 MONTHS LOVE, and many more to come 🫀
    </p>
    <p>With love from your kuchupuchu,<br />To My tamatar ka paudha 🍅💗</p>
